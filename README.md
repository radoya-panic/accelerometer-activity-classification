# Activity classification using accelerometer data

The final project for the course "Using Python for Research" by Harvardx consisted of building a model to classify a form of physical activity using tri-axial accelerometer data. Training and test data was provided and a secondary aim of the project was to minimize run time.

I conducted the majority of my work in the notebook 'Final Project Activity Classification using Smartphone Accelerometer.ipynb', which acted as my workbook for trialing new models and assessing their performace. It is also the workbook in which I assessed the data and produced visualisations of the data to accompany my understanding. Below is an example of some visualisations of the data and of the model performance which assissted in model evaluation.

In the figure below, the highlighted background corresponds to the activity, for which the colour code is:
- red is standing
- green is walking
- blue is stairs down
- cyan is stairs up
