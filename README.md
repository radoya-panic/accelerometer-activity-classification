# Activity classification using accelerometer data

The final project for the course "Using Python for Research" by Harvardx consisted of building a model to classify a form of physical activity using tri-axial accelerometer data. The project is in the form of a jupyter notebook. Training and test data was provided and a secondary aim of the project was to minimize run time.
